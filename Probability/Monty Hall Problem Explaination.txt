The Monty Hall Problem:
You're in a game show, where the host presents you with three doors. He tells you that behind one of the doors is the prize; a brand new car. Behind the other two doors are goats.
The host knows which doors you must pick to win a car.
You may choose any door.
After you choose a door, the host will reveal on of the other two, where a goat is behind.
You are now left with two doors.
The host gives you a chance to change your mind, and pick the other closed door, or stay with the door you originally chose.
After telling the host what you choose, all doors open and you find out where the car was.

The correct choice is to always change your mind. How is that possible?

Do you agree that you have a 1/3 chance to pick the corret door on your first choice? If so, than you must agree that you have a 2/3 chance to pick the wrong door.
Once the host reveales a goat-door (that is different than the door you picked), the chance you have picked a goat-door didn't change, it is still 2/3. And thus, picking the other door is the smart move. A goat-door will always be revealed after you pick a door no matter what. But the chance you picked a goat-door is higher than the chance you picked the car-door.
And so, because the chance you picked a goat-door is higher, once a goat-door is revealed, it is better to change your choice.

C = Scenario picking a car door
G = Scenario picking a goat door

round 1 -> the chance to pick a car is 1/3 and a goat is 2/3
P(C1) = 1/3
P(G1) = 2/3

round 2 -> the chance you picked a car door is the other door is 1/2 and a goat is 1/2 as well.
P(C2) = 1/2
P(G2) = 1/2

P(A) = P(Win by changing door) = P(G1) * P(C2) = 2/3 * 1/2 = 2/6 = 1/3
P(B) = P(Win with same door)   = P(C1) * P(C2) = 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6
P(A) > P(B)
